 Alright team, let's start the weekly sync. Jemi, how's the login page refactor going? Almost done, I fixed the password validation bug. Should be ready by fork QA by mod tomorrow. Great, Taylor. What's the status on the new dashboard mockups? The high fidelity mockups are 80% completed. I'm stuck on the color contrast for accessibility. Jemi, can you check the hex codes I shared? Yeah, I'll review them after this call. Let's aim for a double A compliance. Perfect, let's finalize this by Friday. One blocker. The API response time is slow. We might need back and help. I'll ping the back end team. Taylor, any other dependies? Just need copy for the onboarding tool tips from marketing. Okay, action items. Jemi, deploys the login page by tomorrow. Taylor shares mockups by Friday and I'll follow up with back end and marketing. Any questions? No, all good. Thanks everyone, let's reconvense Wednesday.
